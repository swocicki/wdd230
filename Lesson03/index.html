        <h2>Name</h2>
        <p>I chose Bighorn Basin Weather report because that is the area that
           I am from, and think it would be cool to design a website to fit 
           the demographic that I understand most!</p>
        <h2>URL/Domain Name</h2>
        <p>
            The URL or Domain name for the website would be BBWeather.com
        </p>
        <h2>The Goal</h2>
        <p>
            The Goal for this website would be to provide the citizens of the 
            Bighorn Basin in Wyoming with a reliable website that would update 
            as quickly as possible to warn of the ever-changing weather in Northern
            Wyoming.
